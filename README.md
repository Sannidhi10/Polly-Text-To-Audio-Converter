# Polly-Text-To-Audio-Converter
Converting text to audio using Amazon Polly
The project leverages AWS services to convert text files (such as blog posts, articles, newsletters, or book excerpts) into speech. This is particularly useful for creating audio versions of written content, making it accessible to a wider audience, including those who prefer listening over reading.

Use Cases:
Content Accessibility: Provides audio versions of written content for visually impaired users.
Learning: Enables users to listen to educational materials, enhancing learning experiences.
Content Distribution: Offers an additional medium for content consumption, increasing engagement.
Convenience: Allows users to listen to articles or books while multitasking, such as during commutes or workouts.
